/// A `ViewStore` is an object that can observe state changes and send actions. They are most
/// commonly used in views, such as SwiftUI views, UIView or UIViewController, but they can be
/// used anywhere it makes sense to observe state and send actions.
///
/// In SwiftUI applications, a `ViewStore` is accessed most commonly using the `WithViewStore` view.
/// It can be initialized with a store and a closure that is handed a view store and must return a
/// view to be rendered:
///
///     var body: some View {
///       WithViewStore(self.store) { viewStore in
///         VStack {
///           Text("Current count: \(viewStore.count)")
///           Button("Increment") { viewStore.send(.incrementButtonTapped) }
///         }
///       }
///     }
///
/// In UIKit applications a `ViewStore` can be created from a `Store` and then subscribed to for
/// state updates:
///
///     let store: Store<State, Action>
///     let viewStore: ViewStore<State, Action>
///
///     init(store: Store<State, Action>) {
///       self.store = store
///       self.viewStore = ViewStore(store)
///     }
///
///     func viewDidLoad() {
///       super.viewDidLoad()
///
///       self.viewStore.publisher.count
///         .sink { [weak self] in self?.countLabel.text = $0 }
///         .store(in: &self.cancellables)
///     }
///
///     @objc func incrementButtonTapped() {
///       self.viewStore.send(.incrementButtonTapped)
///     }
